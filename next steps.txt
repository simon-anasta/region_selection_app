## To do list for making a full app

- UI layout
  + instructions
- Map bounds to limit zoom-out
- Distinct colours (unselected, hover, selected)
  + customisation of line weights, opacity
- On hover/popup text with region name
- More detailed shape file
  + performance improvements (e.g. simplify)
- Export functionality
- Reset functionality
- Separate shape preparation from app
  + save preprepared shape file
- Decide on prefered base tiles


Reference:
rmapshaper::ms_simplify instead of rgeos::gSimplify for simplifying polyons.
It uses a different algorithm to create smootherborders, and more importantly
preserves topology (shared boundaries) between adjacent polygons to avoid
gaps and overlaps between shapes.

## Extensions:

- Separate North & South island maps or separate region maps
  to further reduce performance demands
